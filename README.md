### TreeCapitator

Equip an Axe.  Then enter the command `/treecapitator`.  Go to a tree

(which now is floating over the air).

teleport you in the direction you were looking at.

### Trampoline

Place some Sponge on the ground.  Jump on them.  Watch out your
landing!

### CloakClock

Holding a Clock, tap on the sreen.  If it doesn't work, hold the
screen for 1 second.  Will enable invisibility.

### Power Tool

Enter the command `/powertool`.  Equip a pick axe and start tapping on
blocks.  They will be destroyed instantly.

### Floating Toch

Equip a torch, and tap on the screen.  This will create a torch that
will follow you around iluminating the way you are going.

### Magic Carpet
